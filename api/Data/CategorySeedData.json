				"Description": "Manufactured by LFA in Taiwan, the TDP 5 has been built to the most rigorous standards of manufacture and efficiency. We use only the highest quality parts so your TDP 5 will continue to produce pharmaceutical-grade tablets for years to come.\nThe TDP 5 is LFA’s most popular tablet press because of its improvements in quality and ability to get your business or concept off the ground.\nCustomers like Oxford Vitality and Bite were able to start profitable businesses using the TDP 5 for these reasons.\nIf you are looking for a tablet press to help you develop new pills or to test concepts prior to rolling them out for production, the TDP 5’s ability to produce a wide range of tablet sizes in small quantities means that this is definitely the machine for you. Designed to suit the needs of laboratory and developmental work rather than large scale manufacturing, the TDP 5 is nevertheless capable of producing any quantity from just a few tablets all the way up to small production runs of up to 4,800 tablets an hour.\nThe appeal of this tablet press lies in its versatility, combined with a strong feature set and the high quality of its manufacture. The latter ensures excellent reliability. For all these reasons the TDP 5 is a popular choice for use in research institutes, laboratories, food technology applications, pharmaceutical development, chemical plants and hospitals, or any location where flexibility, ease of use and speed are at a premium.\nThis tablet press is exceptionally easy to use, and despite its small size it offers a number of advantages that distinguish it from comparable machines.",
